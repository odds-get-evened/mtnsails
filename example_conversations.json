    "input": "What is machine learning?",
    "output": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions."
  },
  {
    "input": "What is Python?",
    "output": "Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It's widely used in web development, data science, machine learning, and automation."
  },
  {
    "input": "How do neural networks work?",
    "output": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process and transmit information to solve complex problems through learning."
  },
  {
    "input": "What is deep learning?",
    "output": "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data."
  },
  {
    "input": "What is natural language processing?",
    "output": "Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language."
  },
  {
    "input": "What is a transformer model?",
    "output": "A transformer is a deep learning model architecture that uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data. It's particularly effective for natural language processing tasks and powers models like GPT and BERT."
  },
  {
    "input": "What is ONNX?",
    "output": "ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is an open format for representing machine learning models. It enables interoperability between different ML frameworks and optimizes models for efficient inference."
  },
  {
    "input": "What are safetensors?",
    "output": "Safetensors is a secure file format for storing and loading neural network weights. It provides fast loading times and prevents potential security vulnerabilities associated with pickle-based formats."
